          The following lists the manpower and equipment that we have in our
          capacity as an effective service provider. Over the years, the tasks
          that we have delivered, was possible only due to our expertise in
          mobilizing ample manpower to complete the task at hand, in an
          effective, efficient, and timely manner. Our manpower strength,
          combined with a wide range of equipment that we have at our disposal,
          makes even the most difficult of tasks, a cakewalk.
